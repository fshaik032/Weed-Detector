# Weed-Detector
   Farmers and gardeners do spend time classifying weeds, the amount of time and effort devoted to this task can vary widely based on factors such as the scale of farming, available resources, knowledge, technology, and the complexity of the weed population. Weed management is an essential aspect of agriculture and gardening, and accurate classification helps in implementing effective control measures. In order to help people make this classifcations easier, I've created a tool to make this classification easier and help reduce the amount of work and time farmers and gardners have to spend.
